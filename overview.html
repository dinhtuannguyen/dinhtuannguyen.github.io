<h1>Dinh Tuan Nguyen &ndash; Research Overview

<h2>Short Description</h2>
<p>My research interest is mainly on following areas: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hardware security and hardware implementation of cryptography algorithms</p></li>
<li><p>Internet of Things (IoT) Systems and Implementations</p></li>
<li><p>Embedded system design for smart monitoring systems</p></li>
<li><p>Digital ASIC design, FPGA-based and reconfigurable hardware design</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p> My current research interest is <i>Ultra-low power, high-speed authenticated encryption hardware cores for emerging wireless networks</i>. In this project, firstly, based on a deep survey on the development of emerging wireless networks, the security threats and current research issues on the topic of this project, I will clarify the detail requirements for AE cores used in these networks.
Then, several design techniques, architecture and parameter optimization methods will be proposed and employed for two different kinds of emerging networks. For the AE cores in WRAN, AES-GCM is a promising candidate to provide both confidentiality and authentication with the high speed operation. In the proposal project, a number of implementation schemes will be carried out to answer the research question that whether AES-GCM is the best choice for WRAN cryptography. Since AES-GCM can be implemented with pipelined architecture, the optimization for pipeline stage number selection and retiming technique will be investigated. Moreover, many-core architecture based AES-GCM will be investigated as well. In the many-core architecture, I will optimize not only the data-level and task-level parallelism, but also the logic-level and circuit-level parallelism. For WBAN, since the chip size and the power consumption are critical requirements, the low area and low power IC design techniques, as presented in our previous papers as well as the newly proposed ones, will be employed.
